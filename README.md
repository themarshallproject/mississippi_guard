# Mississippi Guard

In Mississippi state prisons, more than half of correction officer jobs are empty. To get a national picture on correction officer vacancy rate, reporters [Joseph Neff](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/joseph-neff) and [Alysia Santo](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/alysia-santo) from The Marshall Project surveyed correctional departments in all 50 states (plus Washington D.C. and the Federal Bureau of Prisons) to compile their vacancy rate.

The data they gathered, which is [included in the repository](https://github.com/themarshallproject/mississippi_guard/blob/master/prison_staff_vacancy_rate.csv), shows that Mississippi has the second-highest correction officer vacancy rate, following only Alabama. Read more about their investigation, [Mississippi Prisons: No One's Safe, Not Even the Guards](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/02/20/mississippi-prisons-no-one-s-safe-not-even-the-guards).
